# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product

!["'/urls' page showing a user's saved URLs with options to edit, delete, or create a new url - as well as logout in the top right corner."](https://github.com/Rdmptn/tinyapp/blob/master/docs/my-urls.png?raw=true)

!["'urls/new' page showing the interface for creating a new URL, which will then create a shortened link and redirect the user to the edit page for that URL."](https://github.com/Rdmptn/tinyapp/blob/master/docs/create-url.png?raw=true)

!["'urls/:shortURL' page showing the original URL as well as the shortened URL which is hyperlinked to the original website, as well as an input to update the long URL for that short URL."](https://github.com/Rdmptn/tinyapp/blob/master/docs/edit-url.png?raw=true)
